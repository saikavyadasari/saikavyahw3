        <p><br>My name is Sai Kavya Dasari. I live in Oklahoma City. I am a Indian. I am the second born of my parent. We are two in number and I have always felt responsible for my family after my elder sibiling. I love my parents and sibling dearly and the feeling is mutual.</br></p>

        <p><br>I am currently persuing my Masters Degree. I have a stable grade and sometimes I cannot rank high among the people in my class, I get by quite well. My favorite subjects are Core languages of Web development. I love to draw, paint and listen music. This is how I often clear my head or distress myself. I desire to go to the university and obtain a degree in my related course. This will help me to become a successful person and also impact the lives of others while I am at it..Iâ€™m always looking for ways to develop my skills and learn new things not just in school but outside the school environment. I share ideas with my friends, we learn interesting things about one another, and most of the people I associate with I met with while on the lookout for ways to advance my skills.</br></p>
